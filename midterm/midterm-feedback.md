# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
50 / 50

This was really well done.  I like the approaches that you took in working with both the range-based scores and sub-score structures.  The only tip I would have is that generally using hard-coded error scores (like 9999) isn't the cleanest way to manage that.  Ideealy, you'd use None as the return value or raise and exception.


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - Nice work on creating the generic rule_points() and get_ranges_score() functions.  I like how you put things together.

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Great work again!


## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Excellent!
